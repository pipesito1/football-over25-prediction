# ⚽ Football Over 2.5 Goals Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning model to predict whether a football match will end with **over 2.5 total goals** using historical match data and league statistics.

The goal is to support sports analytics, betting strategies, and performance analysis through data-driven predictions.

---

## 🚀 Business Problem

Predicting goal distribution in football matches is crucial for:

- Sports analytics
- Betting risk management
- Team performance evaluation
- Fan engagement platforms

This project transforms raw football data into actionable insights using machine learning.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses multiple datasets:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `historico_partidos.csv` | Historical match results |
| `leagues.csv` | League information |
| `seasons.csv` | Season metadata |
| `partidos_en_vivo.xlsx` | Live match data |

These datasets contain match outcomes, goals, leagues, and seasonal context.

---

## 🧠 Methodology

The workflow follows a complete data science pipeline:

1️⃣ Data collection and validation  
2️⃣ Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3️⃣ Feature engineering  
4️⃣ Model training  
5️⃣ Model evaluation  
6️⃣ Model deployment

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

A supervised classification model was trained to predict:

- **1** → Over 2.5 goals  
- **0** → Under 2.5 goals  

### Model Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| Accuracy | XX% |
| Precision | XX% |
| Recall | XX% |
| F1-score | XX% |

> Replace XX% with your real results.

The trained model is stored as:

This allows fast inference without retraining.
